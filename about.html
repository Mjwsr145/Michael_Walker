			<h1>Michael Walker, Sr. - About</h1>

			<p>
			  I have been married for 20 years and have two children. A son, who is a graduate of Bradley University and a daughter that is currently a sophomore at Bradley. I have a 22 month old grand-daughter and another grand child due in January. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I have worked at Bradley since November of 2000. I started as a programmer annalyst in the Information Technology department. In 2007 I took a job as the Director of Admission Technolgy where I have been ever since. I am responsible for all technology in the Enrollment Management division. That includes maintaining the student information database to the tune of over 5 million records.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I have also been involed in the game of football since the age of 8. I started playing at 8 years and old and played until the age of 18 until an injury eneded by playing career. I then began coaching in the fall of 1987 at Peoria High School for the next 2 years. After a short time in the U.S. Air Force I began officiating football for 8 years until my son began playing and I started coaching again. In 2006 I began coaching at Elmwood High school in Elmwood, IL where I am still coaching today. I enjoy the time with the young men I coach and also the time I spend with my fellow coaches. The main coaching staff has been toghether for a combined 62 years.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I also like to work on old cars and tractors. I do not get as much time to do that as I would like but the time I do get I really enjoy. My dad worked for International Harvester until his death in 1985 so I have a love for old International vehicles and tractors. I currently have 3 old International Scouts and somewhere around 10 old International Cub Cadets that I like to work on when time allows.<br> <br>
