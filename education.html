			  I graduated from <a href="https://www.peoriapublicschools.org/phs" target="_blank">Peoria High School</a> in June of 1986. I enrolled at <a href="https://www.eureka.edu/" target="_blank">Eureka College</a> in Eureka, Illinois in the fall of 1986. I played football at Eurka until an unfortuanate injury eneded my playing days.

			<p>
			  In the fall of 1988 I enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and went to <a href="https://www.basictraining.af.mil/" target="_blank">bascic training</a> at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. I spent time in the Air Force and Illinois Air National Guard. In the fall of 1990 I was activated for the first Gulf War. I served on active duty until July of 1991 when I was offered an early discharge from the service since they were trying to downsize after the war. I accepted their offer and was discharged.

			<p>
			  After working different jobs for a few years I started back to school at <a href="https://icc.edu/" target="_blank">Illinois Central College</a> in the fall of 1997. I graduated from ICC with an Associate in Science with a concentration in Data Processing. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  I began working at <a href="https://bradley.edu/" target="_blank">Bradley</a> in the fall of 2000 and in the summer of 2002 I started to take calsses at Bradley. I have been working on my Bachelor degree ever since. I have taken classes as I have had time but am now only 18 hours away from getting my Bachelor degree.
