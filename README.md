# Michael_Walker
# I created this repository as part of my Project #1 for CIS 445 in the fall of 2021 at Bradley University
# This was to show my abilities with Git, GitHub, HTML and CSS.
# Added a seperate css file style.css to keep the css in one place.
# Added a seperate JavaScript file to use to call a script to add the date to the nav bar
# I tried to use as many html tags as necessary. I used some inline styling to complement the css file
# I also used tables to control some of the spacing and content on the hobbies page
